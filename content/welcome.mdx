My name is Igor Souza, I'm a Data Scientist since 2017, I started on the programming world as a web developer, my very first software development was a web tool for a Car Wash using java/spring and html5, It was very challenging.

I was very young and green, and things didn't turn out as planned. Nonetheless, I continued to study the subject, at the same time that I started studying machine learning, it was my great passion!

The years have arrived and I was becoming more and more involved in Machine Learning projects. I began to work with computer vision which has improved by a thousand all my skills, especially in the area of development. Data science and computer vision remain my number one passion and what I strive to do in my work. However, I always nurture the love of software development, studying and working on related projects.

## What to expect from here?

You can expect it all, from cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to foundational design models, insightful tips, and thought-provoking discussions.
